# Luria-Delbrück model to estimate mutation rate from WGS 

This repository is part of my three-year degree thesis in Physics at Università Statale di Milano (UniMi), written in Italian under the guide of the advisor Prof. M. Cosentino Lagomarsino and the co-advisor Dr. Simone Pompei. It contains the Python codes used to perform simulations of the Luria-Delbrück model applied to the estimation of the spontaneous mutation rate of mammalian cancer cell lines via Whole Genome Sequencing. It also contains the C++ code used to perform data analysis from a real sequencing dataset. 

Referring to the sections of the thesis:

1. The folder `LD_Simulations` contains Jupyter Notebooks used to perform simulations presented in chapter 3 about the LD estimator and error models.

2. The folder `LD_Data_Analysis` contains codes that explain the analysis of experimental data, as described in chapter 4. (The dataset is not present) 

3. The folder `EDU_Simulations` contains Jupyter Notebooks used to perform simulations of incorporation experiments presented in appendix A.
